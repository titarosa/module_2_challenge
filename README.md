# Module 02 Challenge: Advanced CSS Portfolio

## Your Task

n this challenge, I'm leveraging my skills in flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to create a compelling portfolio. By showcasing my top projects and explaining my design choices, I'm aiming to stand out to potential employers. Deploying these projects online is crucial for getting noticed in the job market. This challenge isn't just about improving my skills; it's about building a portfolio that sets me apart and boosts my career prospects.


## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Repository Quality

- **Challenges Faced:** One of the primary challenges I encountered during this project was transitioning the entire document to adhere to HTML semantic standards while removing all unnecessary div elements. This task required careful consideration of the document structure and the appropriate use of semantic HTML elements to maintain clarity and accessibility.
